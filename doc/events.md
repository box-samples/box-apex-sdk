Events
======

The Box API provides an events endpoint that utilizes long-polling to send events in real-time. Apex doesn't allow for long-polling so this class is mainly a stub for any API calls that might return an Event object. 

There is no built-in functionality to "listen" for events.  If Salesforce allows for this type of API call in the future, methods around events will be implemented.
