Box SDK for Salesforce
======================

This is the Box SDK for Salesforce for interacting with the 
[Box Content API](https://box-content.readme.io/).

Quickstart
----------
The SDK can be deployed directly to Sandbox or Developer Orgs by clicking
<a href="https://githubsfdeploy.herokuapp.com?owner=box-samples&repo=box-apex-sdk">
  <img alt="Deploy to Salesforce"
       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afawcett/githubsfdeploy/master/src/main/webapp/resources/img/deploy.png">
</a>
"Deploy to Salesforce" functionality is not owned or operated by Box.

The SDK is also distributed as an umanaged package.  Unmanaged packages can't be upgraded once installed in a Salesforce org so future upgrades will have to be applied by cloning the repo locally and updating classes from your IDE.

Running Tests

Tests are always executed when deploying code to a production salesforce org.  To manually run tests from a sandbox or developer org, go to Setup -> Develop -> Apex Classes and click the "Run All Tests" button.
